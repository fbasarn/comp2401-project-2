## Project 2, Data Entry
This program involves multiple systems that uses/produce resources, generate events and are managed by a central manager.

## Building and Running
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the program files.
2. Type command 'make run'
3. This will create the necessary object files, an executable file and will directly run the executable without any more commands.
4. To clear the object files and the executable file, type command 'make clean' after running.
